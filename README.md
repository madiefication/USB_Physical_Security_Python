### Project Objectives:
The application allows administrators to:
- Enable and disable USB storage dynamically for security purposes.
- Format connected USB drives.
- Ensure data security with passkey verification and USB state management (Enable State, Disable State, Format Pendrive).
- Access an intuitive and user-friendly interface for efficient management.

### Project Structure:
- __Main Application:__ A Tkinter-based GUI for managing USB storage devices.
- __Core Features:__ Includes functionality to enable/disable USB ports, format pendrives, and display project details.
- __Images and Resources:__ All necessary image files and a HTML file are included for UI enhancements.
- __Executable:__ The project is compiled into an executable file for easy distribution and use.

### Collaboration:
This project was completed with collaboration between two team members. I handled the coding part using Python and the Kivy platform for the backend development. My team member managed the HTML file and documentation, focusing on the frontend and UI/UX aspects.

### Files:
- __main.py:__ The primary Python script containing the core logic and Tkinter GUI for the application.
- __logo.jpg:__ The logo image displayed in the "About Us" section of the application.
- __bot.jpg:__ An image used in the "About Us" section, showcasing additional design elements.
- __wa.jpeg:__ The background image for the application's main window.
- __ques.png:__ The question mark icon used for the help button in the application.
- __ena.jpg:__ The image used for the "Enable USB" button.
- __disa.jpg:__ The image used for the "Disable USB" button.
- __ProjectDetails.html:__ An HTML file containing the project details, which can be opened from the "Project Details" button.
- __logo1.ico:__ It is the image which is added as a logo for the .exe file.
- __.exe file:__ The compiled executable file of the application for direct use without requiring Python installation.

### Installation:
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

- __Clone the repository:__ <br>


         git clone https://github.com/Shaikh-Aiman/USB-Physical-Security.git


- __Navigate to the project directory:__
cd USB-Physical-Security
- __Ensure you have Python installed on your system.__
- __Install the required dependencies.__
- __Run the application:__
python main.py
- __Alternatively, use the provided .exe file for a direct run without dependencies.__

### Working:
- __Launch the Application:__
  - The application is launched by executing the .exe file or running the main.py script if the Python environment is set up.
  - A user-friendly graphical interface, developed using the Tkinter library, is displayed.
- __Authentication:__
  - The application includes a passkey verification system to ensure that only authorized users can access and manage USB device settings.
  - Upon entering the correct passkey, users can access the applicationâ€™s features.
- __Enable or Disable USB Access:__
  - The "Enable USB" button allows the user to restore functionality to USB storage devices.
  - Clicking the button runs backend logic to re-enable USB ports, ensuring they can read/write data.
  - The "Disable USB" button restricts access to USB storage devices.
  - Clicking this button prevents USB ports from reading or writing data, ensuring enhanced security against unauthorized transfers.
- __Format USB Drives:__
  - The application includes functionality to format connected USB drives.
  - Users can select the desired USB drive from a list and initiate formatting, removing all data and preparing it for reuse.
- __Help and Documentation:__
  - The application has a help feature, providing a guide on how to use the software.
  - A "Project Details" button opens the ProjectDetails.html file, containing comprehensive documentation about the application, including its features and usage.
- __Additional Features:__
  - __"About Us" Section:__ Displays project and developer details, including the application's purpose, contributors, and contact information.
- __Executable File for Ease of Use:__ The .exe file allows users to operate the application without installing Python or its dependencies, making it convenient for administrators to use the tool on any Windows system.

### Usage of All Buttons:
- __Enable USB:__ Re-enables USB storage ports on the system.
- __Disable USB:__ Disables USB storage ports to prevent unauthorized access.
- __Format Pendrive:__ Formats the detected pendrive (requires admin rights).
- __Help:__ Opens a popup with a description of all buttons.
- __About Us:__ Displays project details and team members.
- __Project Details:__ Opens a HTML file with additional information.

### Conclusion:
The USB Physical Device Manager is a reliable, efficient, and secure application for managing USB storage access. Developed with a focus on security and usability, this tool is ideal for environments that require strict control over data transfers. The inclusion of a passkey-protected interface ensures that only authorized personnel can manage USB access, making it an essential tool for organizations concerned about data security.
